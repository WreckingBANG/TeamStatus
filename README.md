A simple and lightweight Android App for monitoring where your coworkors are at the moment.

THE APP IS A BETA

The Idea:

Place a Tablet next to the Entrance. Everytime a
Co-Worker is going into the building he updates his
Status. Everytime he leaves for a Job he updates
his Status. 

Now Co-Workers know who is Home, at a Job or in the 
Building. If there is a Emergency, just grab the 
Tablet and you have a List who is in the Building.
